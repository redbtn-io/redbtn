/**
 * Capability model for the data-permissions layer.
 *
 * # What this is
 *
 * A small, fail-closed capability model that lets an agent (graph config) be
 * *jailed* to a subset of a user's DATA — currently State (global-state
 * namespaces) and Knowledge (libraries). Enforcement happens at the native-tool
 * execution layer (see `enforce.ts` + the hook in `native-registry.ts`), never
 * via prompt text.
 *
 * # The shape
 *
 * A capability is `{ resource, action, selector }`:
 *   - `resource` — which data domain the grant covers (`state` | `knowledge`).
 *       The union is intentionally open-ended in spirit: automations / graphs /
 *       nodes can be added as resources later WITHOUT touching the enforcement
 *       core. They are deliberately NOT implemented now.
 *   - `action`   — `read` | `write` | `create` | `delete`. Every data tool is
 *       mapped to exactly one action in `tool-map.ts`.
 *   - `selector` — a glob/prefix string matched against the resource address
 *       (the State namespace, or the Knowledge library name/id). Supported
 *       forms: exact (`coder`), prefix-glob (`coder/*` or `coder*`), wildcard
 *       (`*`), and the explicit deny token (`none`).
 *
 * A `CapabilityProfile` is a named bundle of grants attached to an agent.
 *
 * # The backward-compat contract (THE most important rule)
 *
 * A run with NO capability profile is UNRESTRICTED — today's behavior. Existing
 * worker automations, chat agents, and graphs that never declare a profile are
 * completely unaffected. Only a run whose graph config carries a
 * `CapabilityProfile` is enforced, and then strictly + fail-closed: a data tool
 * whose address has no matching grant is DENIED.
 *
 * @module lib/permissions/types

/**
 * Domains a capability can cover.
 *   - `state` / `knowledge` — DATA resources. FAIL-OPEN: no profile ⇒ unrestricted
 *     (backward-compatible; see enforce.ts).
 *   - `exec` / `computer` / `environment` — HIGH-RISK resources. FAIL-CLOSED: denied
 *     unless a profile explicitly grants them (a deliberate departure from the data
 *     default — running shell / controlling a machine is too dangerous to inherit the
 *     permissive default). See `FAIL_CLOSED_RESOURCES` in enforce.ts.
